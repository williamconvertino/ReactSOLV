# ReactSOLV

This project is still a WIP and is temporarily on hold.

ReactSOLV (Simple Object List Visualizer) is a general purpose library for generating, managing, and displaying lists of JS objects.

There are 4 packages currently available:

# [react-solv]()

This is the complete library, and the recommended package to install. It includes the functionality of all of the components below. Use this for access to all that ReactSOLV has to offer.

# [react-solv-api]()

This package extends the base ReactSOLV features to generate lists using API calls.

# [react-solv-routes]()

This package integrates the base ReactSOLV features with the React Routers library. This allows for list management based on URL's and queries.

# [react-solv-base]()

This is the core functionality of the library, and is completely dependency free. All the other packages already include this, so only install this package if you're sure you don't need any of the other functionality.
